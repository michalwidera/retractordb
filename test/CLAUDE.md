# Test tree — known pitfalls

### Integration test file sync

`test/CMakeLists.txt` copies `test/` → build dir at **cmake configure time**. After editing `.rql`, `data.txt`, or a test `.sh`:
- Re-run cmake, **or** manually copy to `build/Debug/test/...`
- `CTestTestfile.cmake` is CMake-generated — do NOT overwrite with `CMakeLists.txt`; different formats.

**Reconfigure (`cmake .`) wipes built unit-test binaries.** The `test/` copy step regenerates the `build/Debug/test/` subtree, deleting `test_*` binaries → ctest fails with `No such file or directory` for ~all unit tests. After any `cmake .`, rebuild with `ninja` before `ctest`.

**Integration tests run the *installed* binary + the *build-copied* script, not source.** Editing a `.sh` and the C++ it exercises requires syncing both: build, install, recopy script, rebuild test binaries. Full sequence after touching integration `.sh` + source:
```bash
ninja && ninja install && cmake . && ninja && ctest
```
